# Tower Climber
2D Sprite-Based Action Platformer game made with Unreal Engine.

## 🎮 Gameplay
In Tower-Climber, you play as a character navigating a vertically-scrolling 2D world made entirely of sprites. Your goal is to reach the top of a dangerous tower filled with roaming enemies and tricky platforms.
